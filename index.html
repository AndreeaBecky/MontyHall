    <p class="h1">Monty Hall Paradox</p>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>

    <p><strong>The Monty Hall</strong> is a paradox put in the form of a puzzle and it's based on the American
        television game show "Let's Make a Deal" and named after its original host, Monty Hall. Suppose you're on a game
        show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a
        door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a
        goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p>

            alt="Responsive image" class="img-center" />
    </div>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

    <p>
        There are three doors. One of these doors contains a prize. The other two do not. Therefore, the probability
        that any one of the doors contains the prize is 1/3. If the Monty Hall problem ended with the selection of the
        first door, we could safely predict that one time out of three, the door picked will contain a prize; and that
        the contestant will go home with a brand-new car.
    </p>

    <p>
        These are the probabilities we face when we are confronted by these three doors: the probability of one door
        being the door which hides a prize is 1/3, and the probability that it is not the prize-hiding door is 2/3.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>The solution</h2>

    <p>
        The probabilities of your initial choice being correct, and the remaining choices have to sum to equal one.
        Therefore, the probability of the remaining choices have to sum to equal one minus the probability of your
        initial choice. In this case (with three doors), they have to sum to equal 2/3. Say a door isn't opened. Then,
        you would have two to switch to (if you choose to switch — this would be like “changing your mind”), and your
        chance of picking the correct door would be 1/2 × 2/3. Well, that's 1/3, just like your initial choice. But if
        Monty has to open a door, then you'll only have one door to switch to.
    </p>

    <p> <strong> In this case (which is the Monty Hall problem), you'll pick the remaining door — so that'd be 1 × 2/3.
            And that's a probability of 2/3. </strong>

    <em>In other words....</em> <br>
    <p class="other-words border border-info">
        There is a 1/3 chance of the car being behind door number 1 and a 2/3 chance that the car isn’t behind door
        number 1. After Monty Hall opens door number 2 to reveal a goat,
        <br>
        there’s still a 1/3 chance that the car is behind door number 1 and a 2/3 chance that the car isn’t behind door
        number 1.
        <br>
        <strong>A 2/3 chance that the car isn’t behind door number 1 is a 2/3 chance that the car is behind door number
            3.

        The simulation above shows us that out of 100.000 tests in which the contestants had to choose if they want to
        change the door (or not), the percentage of those who won is statistically significant than the ones who didn't.
        We could say that the ratio is roughly: 66% - won, 33% - lost. Each set of 100.000 tests were taken separately,
        that's why the total percentage is not 100%. Also, we can see that the duration for the simulation where the
        contestants changed their choice is slighly longer than the in those simulation where the contestants did not
        change their mind.

        <br>
        <br>
        Thus, we can generalize for N-door version. N-door generalization of the original problem in which the host
        opens p losing doors and then offers the player the opportunity to switch; in this variant switching wins with
        probability <img
            src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/02610edd1a957c0c80e719d5d61eae662d71e292" />
        This probability is always greater than <img
            src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8fb12c5f73f8763997550a9abdf59b00c4932ee4" />,
        therefore switching always brings an advantage.

        Even if the host opens only a single door <img
            src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c29a2f2fb3f642618036ed7a79712202e7ada924" />,
        the player is better off switching
        in every case. As N grows larger, the advantage decreases and approaches zero.

        At the other extreme, if the host opens all losing doors but one (p = N − 2) the advantage increases as N grows
        large (the probability of winning by switching is N − 1/N, which approaches 1 as N grows very large).
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>
            The difference in probability for switching is shown to diminish as the number of doors increases. It's
            important to say that we are just adding more doors, but Monty is still opening only one door, and that's
            why the difference is getting smaller.</strong>
        So, as N gets large the difference between the two gets smaller and smaller. The case with 3 door, is the case
        where you gain the most by switching.
